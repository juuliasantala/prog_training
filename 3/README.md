## Small exercises
You can work on the small exercises on either interactive python shell in terminal (python / py -i), or save them as python files and run them with python script.py / py script.py.
Remember to activate the virtual environment, and never work outside of it. To create a virtual environment for session 3 exercises, you can do for example:

Mac:
```
$ python3 -m venv session3_exercises 
$ source session3_exercises/bin/activate

```
Windows:
```
$ py -3 -m venv session3_exercises 
$ source session3_exercises/Scripts/activate

```

You need to create the virtual environment only once, after that you just use source to activate it.
