## Setting up your environment

What do I need for the exercises?
1. DevNet account (get one at developer.cisco.com)
2. Python 3 installed on your laptop
3. Git to clone code from github
4. Code editor (for example Atom)

If unsure, use the DevNet Learning labs to help install Python, git and code editor (a DevNet account required)

- Windows: https://developer.cisco.com/learning/devnet-express/dnav4-track/dev-setup/dev-win/step/1

For our sessions it is enough to go through steps 1-5.
There is more in the guide than what we need for now. No need for Node or things that are under steps 6 and 7.
