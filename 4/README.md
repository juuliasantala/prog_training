You can try the excercises with interactice python shell in terminal (python / py -i), but I recommend you to save the final code as a Python file (run with python script.py / py script.py). Remember to activate the virtual environment, and never work outside of it. You can use the same environment through out the sessions, and activate it by using source together with the part to your environments "activate" functionality. Here is an example of creating a virtual environment and activating it:

Mac:
```
$ python3 -m venv session3_exercises 
$ source session3_exercises/bin/activate

```
Windows:
```
$ py -3 -m venv session3_exercises 
$ source session3_exercises/Scripts/activate

```

You need to create the virtual environment only once, after that you just use source to activate it.
